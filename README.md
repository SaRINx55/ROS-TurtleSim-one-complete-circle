# ROS-TurtleSim-one-complete-circle
This repository is task0 in eyrc 2020-21 where we had to move the turtle in a circular direction and make it stop at the initial position. The above code gives a d(theta) = 0.2563 on my device (it may be different on yours). Overall, move_turtle_circle.py worked very well.
the task0.launch file contains some parameters that help in recording the data generated by the turtle's movement.
